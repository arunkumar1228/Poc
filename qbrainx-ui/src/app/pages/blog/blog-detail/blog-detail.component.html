                Why does the pharmaceutical sector require big data technologies
                and a digital transformation? The majority of pharmaceutical
                executives are perplexed and focused on the above question and
                you are one of them then. Let’s start with the fundamentals, so
                this is not too perplexing.<br /><br />As a result of the fact

                transformation and big data, it is now time to flourish in the
                pharmaceutical industry.<br /><br />We also understand that the
                pharma sector is in the adoption phase of the digital revolution
                and big data. This is why the pharmaceutical industry is growing
                quickly, like the compound annual growth rate. We refrain from
                referring to this as a laborious process because the combination
                of Big Data & Digital Transformation makes it quite simple to
                handle all of them. Let’s start at the beginning before delving
                deeper into this area.
